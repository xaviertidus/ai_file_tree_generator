# .treeignore for Ubuntu Root (Focusing on User Files)

This .treeignore file is designed to exclude common system, application, and hidden/temporary files/directories on an Ubuntu root drive (/), allowing the tree generator to focus primarily on "user files." User files typically refer to personal data in user home directories (e.g., under /home/username/, like Documents, Pictures, Downloads), while ignoring OS core components, installed packages, caches, and system artifacts.

Place this .treeignore file in the root (/) or the directory you're scanning (e.g., /home). Ubuntu may require sudo for root writes.

Key assumptions:
- Ignores system directories (e.g., /boot, /etc, /usr, /var) entirely.
- Ignores hidden system files (e.g., /proc, /sys, swap files).
- Shows /home but uses `contents:` for .cache (show the folder but hide contents, as it's often semi-system/cache-heavy).
- Ignores common temp/log areas.
- Handles Ubuntu/Linux-specific patterns; use wildcards for reliability (e.g., *.deb for package caches).

If you want to include/exclude more (e.g., show /var but hide subdirs), customize further. Test with the script to verify.

# README.md for Ubuntu Root .treeignore (User Files Focus)

## Overview

This `.treeignore` file is tailored for scanning the root drive (/) on Ubuntu systems using tools like the `ai-file-tree-generator` script (or similar tree-generating utilities). Its primary goal is to exclude non-user-related files and directories, focusing the output on "user files" such as personal documents, downloads, and profile data under `/home/username/`. This helps in generating clean directory trees for backups, audits, sharing with AI assistants, or documentation without clutter from system files, packages, or caches.

By using this ignore file, the tree output will primarily highlight user-generated content while hiding or partially showing system-heavy areas. It's especially useful for privacy (e.g., avoiding exposure of system configs) or efficiency (e.g., reducing output size).

**Note**: Ubuntu/Linux file systems can be sensitive—run scripts with appropriate permissions (e.g., sudo if needed for root). Always back up before automating scans.

## Features and Design

- **Focus on User Files**: Prioritizes paths like `/home/username/Documents`, `Downloads`, `Pictures`, etc., by excluding system roots.
- **Partial Exclusions with `contents:`**: For directories like `.cache` (which contains user caches but is often not purely "user content"), it shows the folder but ignores its contents.
- **Common Ubuntu Patterns**: Handles system files (e.g., `vmlinuz`), hidden lost+found, package caches, and temp areas.
- **Wildcards and Globs**: Uses patterns like `*.deb` to catch variations (e.g., package archives).
- **Assumptions**:
  - Assumes a standard Ubuntu installation (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or later) with default filesystem layout.
  - "User files" are defined as non-system, personal data; if you consider installed packages as "user," adjust exclusions.
  - Ignores all of `/usr` and `/var`—customize if you need partial inclusion (e.g., show but hide contents).
  - Does not account for custom partitions, LVM setups, or non-standard configurations (e.g., separate /home partition).
  - Compatible with tools supporting `.gitignore`-like patterns, but optimized for `ai-file-tree-generator`'s features (e.g., `contents:` prefix).
  - No handling for encrypted/protected folders (e.g., ecryptfs); access issues may occur.

If your definition of "user files" differs (e.g., include certain /var subdirs), edit the file accordingly.

## Usage

1. **Placement**: Copy the `.treeignore` file to the root you're scanning (e.g., `sudo cp .treeignore /`). If using a subdirectory, place it there and adjust relative paths.

2. **With ai-file-tree-generator Script**:
   - Ensure the script is executable: `chmod +x ai-file-tree-generator.sh`.
   - Example command to generate a tree (run with sudo for root):
     ```
     sudo ./ai-file-tree-generator.sh --format grok-ascii /
     ```
     This outputs to `tree.txt`, focusing on user-relevant parts.
   - For JSON output:
     ```
     sudo ./ai-file-tree-generator.sh --format json --pack /
     ```
   - If no `.treeignore` exists, the script will prompt to create a sample— you can replace it with this one.

3. **Customization**:
   - Add patterns for specific exclusions (e.g., `/home/username/Videos` if large).
   - Use `contents:` for folders you want to acknowledge but not detail (e.g., `contents:home/*/Desktop` to hide desktop contents).
   - Test with a dry run: Run the script and review output before final use.

4. **Limitations**:
   - Linux paths are case-sensitive, so patterns are exact—ensure matches.
   - Large filesystems may take time; consider scanning subdirs like `/home` instead.
   - Hidden/system files require sudo to scan fully.
   - Not for non-Ubuntu Linux distros without tweaks; adapt for mounted volumes or /media.

## Installation and Dependencies

- **ai-file-tree-generator Script**: Download from its repo (if using). No install needed—it's a standalone Bash script. On Ubuntu, it runs natively in Terminal.
- **tree Command** (Optional but Recommended): For better ASCII output. Install via apt:
  ```
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install tree
  ```
  Verify: `tree --version`.
- **Permissions**: For root scans: `sudo` prefix. For user dirs: No special perms needed.
